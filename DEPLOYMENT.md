4. Use these settings:
   - Build Command: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build`
   - Start Command: `npm start`

## Option 5: Deploy using Docker

A Dockerfile has been created for containerized deployment:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t my-nextjs-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-nextjs-app
```

## Option 6: Deploy to any Node.js hosting

Since the app is already built, you can deploy to any Node.js hosting:

1. Upload all files to your server
2. Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` 
3. Run `npm run build` (if not already built)
4. Run `npm start` to start the production server

## Environment Variables

If your app uses environment variables, create a `.env.production` file or configure them in your hosting platform's dashboard.

## Build Output

The production build is already complete and located in:
- `.next/` - Production build output
- `public/` - Static assets

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Or deploy with Vercel CLI (after login)
vercel --prod
```
